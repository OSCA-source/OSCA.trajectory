Description: 
    Deploys trajectory analysis chapters for the "Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" book.
    This describes trajectory reconstruction, detection of differentially expressed genes along lineages, 
    visualization of , determination of directionality and RNA velocity analyses. It is intended for users who 
    are already familiar with the basic concepts of scRNA-seq analyses in R, possibly after reading other books in this series.
